# Debt Graph Project

This is an interactive tool for visualizing debt projections under various plans for revenue and spending. Intended for embedding in blogs or other informational pages, the tool allows the user to set their own levels of spending and revenue, starting from the plans of Presidential Candidates Trump and Clinton, as well as current law.

## Implementation Details

Uses `JQuery` and the Google Visualization API, along with basic `HTML` and `CSS`. Styled statically.

## Modeling Information

Dynamic projection model developed from debt projections by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Economic feedback and dynamic effects of debt are not incorporated. Projections for Social Security, Medicare, and defense spending are from the Congressional Budget Office's March 2016 baseline.
